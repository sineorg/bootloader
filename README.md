# Bootloader

##### Version: 0.1.0

This is the official bootloader for Sine, allowing it to load into the DOM.

This bootloader is a fork of [fx-autoconfig](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/fx-autoconfig) from version 0.10.7 but minified and specializes in loading Sine rather than several scripts.

## Installation
The bootloader can be installed using the [auto-installers for Sine](https://github.com/CosmoCreeper/Sine/releases/latest) or [manually](https://github.com/sineorg/docs/blob/main/src/installation.md) if preferred, but it will not work without Sine.
